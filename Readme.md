This folder contains files written for the OS assignment of making a basic shell

The includes directory contains all the header files needed for compilation

Makefile consists of command(s) required to generate executable

After running the makefile it will generate an executable called myshell

I used execvp function of exec family to execute commands

Run make to obtain an executable and make clean to remove it 

Logic behind the code is explained in comments
 If you press ctrl+c then shell doesnot exit
ctrl+d exits the shell

piping and redirection done

overkill done

quit exits the shell
